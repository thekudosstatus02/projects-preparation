As my other friends answered , it will be completely about what you did ,
your role and your milestones you faced while finishing it.

In my personal experience , Since i played the role of team leader I was asked :-

How did I assign the work to my team members?

On what basis did i divide the work and assigned it to them.

We were using few new technologies in our project , so were asked to explain
in what way did we use those new features in those technologies.

And of course , the issues faced while doing the project and ways we used to overcome it.

Software model used in our project. ( i.e waterfall model , spiral model etc â€¦)

Warnings and errors we got while compiling the code , and how we got rid of the warnings.

Also asked the concepts used in our project.

And Of course , he asked us to explain the code . Not the whole of it , but code used for
redirection and connection to database etc..

And for the UI part of the project we used HTML5 , so asked the differences between
HTML and HTML5 which was not answered.

And finally , the duration we took to complete the backend code , Front end code , documenting reports etc.

Different use cases , test cases used.

So think , you can expect similar type of questions while presenting your projects to the interviewer.
